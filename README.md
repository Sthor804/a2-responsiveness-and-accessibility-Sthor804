### Sketches for the website and short description
**All sketches can be found in the "Sketches" folder.**

**Our Product**-
Our product is basically a website which contains some quicknotes and interesting implementation examples that programmers can refer to. Our website will also act as a place where people can ask questions which can be answered for them by using a form on our website. Our webiste/company name will be "Prognotes" and it will act as online ocmpilation of notes for programmers as well as a place to seek help. 

**Homepage Sketch -**
The homepage will be the page that users are supposed to see when they intilaly visit our website. This page will have informaton about the company and the company vision. The page will also inform users about our services. In order ot make it easy for users to navigate through the pages, there will be a navigation bar at the top of the page for users to click on a tab and be redirected to another page. The main page will have an image to draw in the users attention and to show the user our logo or something else related to our company. The footer contains links to the other pages, but in fine print for easy access. 

**Page 1 Sketch -** 
Page 1 will be the page that will contain all things realted to the Java programming language. This page will have some basic tips for users on how to begin coding in Java on eclipe. The first image will contain some Java code on eclipse with tips such as creating getter and setter or etc. in addition, the aside elemnt will be present to give the websites contents some credibility beacuse the source of information as well as the date it was generated will be given to the user. Not only that, but the bottom of the page will include some quicknotes that programmers can refer to for Javan and will also include some interesting ways to implement the Javan programming language. There will also be two images at the bottom which will show some cool ways to implement Java or will show the user a popualr platform which was mainly coded in Java. The footer contains links to the other pages, but in fine print for easy access. 

**Page 2 Sketch -** 
The 2nd page about Python will be quite similar to the Java page except we will show VS code instead of eclipse. It will focus on Python as a versatile programming language, with content and examples shown with VS Code. The page will include a basic Introduction to Python/ an overview to introduce the user to our website and show what it's about and its widespread applications. We will also have a section dedicated to Apps/Websites Coded in Python by showing well-known apps or websites developed using Python, along with images and brief descriptions. This page will have a similar design to the Java page, maintaining consistent styling and structure across the website with a shared navigation menu and company logo.

**Page 3 Sketch -** 
The Final page (contact form) will be a contact us form using the post method to email information to us. It is designed to gather user information and feedback, and using the Post method will securely submit the data to an email address. The form will include essential input fields such as:

Salutation (e.g., Mr., Ms.)

First and Last Name – Required fields for proper identification.

Phone Number and Email Address – Formatted with appropriate patterns to ensure valid entries.

Subject – A brief description of the reason for contacting.

Message Body – A text area for users to provide detailed information or inquiries.

Radio Buttons – To select options like preferred method of contact.

Checkboxes – For agreeing to terms or subscribing to newsletters. ( may be changed) 

Reset and Submit Buttons – The reset button clears all inputs, while the submit button sends the information to the designated email.

The form will be styled with CSS to ensure a consistent look with the rest of the website. All elements, from fonts to color schemes, will adhere to the overall design of the website, ensuring a seamless user experience across pages.This page will maintain consistent styling and structure across the website with a shared navigation menu and company logo.

# Part 2

**Samantha**
- Page 2(Python),
- Creating the form - putting placeholders and correct format and pattern to validate the input.

### Gestalt principles write-up (point form)
> Include images here to make your points easier to understand (and you will have to write less too!)
- Proximity:
    Our list items show proximit in the way they are orderd (ordered and unordered lists are grouped together). For example, the steps under "Getting Started with Python" are visually close to each other, helping readers understand that they are part of a sequence.

- Similarity:
The strong tags for headings within the lists and sections give them a consistent style, bolding the headings to make it for users to recognize the structure and importance of each point.

- Continuity:
The layout of your code, with ordered lists and indentati on in the examples, helps guide the reader's eye through the content smoothly, following the natural flow of information.
- Figure/Ground:
The use of a clear background (white or a light color) contrasts with the dark text, making the content easily readable and makes the text stand out. The headers and navigation elements stand out against the body text, allowing users to differentiate between the sections.
- Closure:
We used closre by using images/ logo to fill in the gaps of our website. we use the use of imahges so the users can infer what action to take, even if the full context isn't explicitly displayed.

- Common Fate: 
When elements on a webpage move or change together and smoothly 
Our nav changes colours simultaneously on hover, users understand that they are linked in function and directs the users. 

- Symmetry:
We Used symmetry in our layouts to create an aesthetically pleasing design that feels stable and organized. This is applied by images, text blocks, and overall page layouts. Our elements aligned evenly on either side contribute to a sense of order.
