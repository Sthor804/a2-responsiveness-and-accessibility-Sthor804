        <section class = javaBeg>
            <p>Java was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s, initially as part of the "Green Project," which aimed to create a platform-independent language for programming consumer electronics. Released in 1995, Java quickly gained popularity due to its “write once, run anywhere” philosophy, achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allowed Java code to run on any device with a compatible JVM.
                <br>
                The first official version, Java 1.0, was revolutionary in offering automatic memory management, built-in support for network programming, and a security model that made it ideal for web applets. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Java saw widespread adoption in enterprise software with the introduction of Java 2 (J2EE), which added robust frameworks and APIs for web and server-side development. 
                <br>
                In 2006, Sun Microsystems made Java open-source, further accelerating its adoption and contributions from the developer community. Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, becoming the steward of Java and continuing its development. Since then, Java has seen regular updates, with a switch to a faster release cycle in 2017, enabling more frequent and incremental improvements. Today, Java remains one of the world’s most widely used programming languages, integral to web, mobile, enterprise, and IoT applications.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>For loop</strong> Used when the number of iterations is known.

                <pre><code>
                    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                        System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
                    }                    
                </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced For loop</strong> Simplified loop for iterating over arrays or collections.

                <pre><code>
                    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                        System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
                    }                    
                </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>While loop</strong> Used when the number of iterations isn’t known in advance; runs while the condition is true
                <pre><code>
                    int i = 0;
                    while (i < 5) {
                        System.out.println("Count: " + i);
                        i++;
                    }                    
                </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Do-While</strong> Simplified loop for iterating over arrays or collections.

                <pre><code>
                    int i = 0;
                    do {
                        System.out.println("Count: " + i);
                        i++;
                    } while (i < 5);                                    
                </code></pre>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>5. Methods </h4>
        <p>In Java, functions are referred to as **methods**, which are blocks of code within a class designed to perform specific tasks. A method's structure includes a return type, a method name, and any parameters needed for its operation. To declare a method, you specify its return type (e.g., `int`, `String`, or `void` if it returns nothing) followed by the method name and any parameters in parentheses. For example, `public int add(int a, int b)` defines a method named `add` that takes two integer parameters and returns an integer. To call a method, you use the method's name along with required arguments, like `obj.add(5, 10)` where `obj` is an instance of the class containing the method.
            Java methods can return a value using the `return` statement, or they can have a `void` return type, indicating they perform an action but don’t return data. Java also supports **method overloading**, which allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameter lists. This enables methods to perform similar tasks with varying inputs. Methods can also be **static**, meaning they belong to the class itself rather than an instance, allowing you to call them without creating an object. Static methods are useful for operations that don’t require object-specific data, such as `Math.sqrt()` in the standard library. 
            In practice, methods allow Java programs to be organized into reusable, readable, and modular pieces, enhancing code maintenance and reusability. For instance, a simple `Calculator` class can have methods for addition, multiplication, or any other operations, which can be called as needed in a structured and logical way.</p>
        <pre><code>
            public class Rectangle {
                // Method to calculate the area of a rectangle
                public int calculateArea(int width, int height) {
                    return width * height;
                }
            
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    // Creating an instance of Rectangle
                    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
            
                    // Calling the calculateArea method with width and height
                    int area = rect.calculateArea(5, 10);
            
                    // Printing the result
                    System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is: " + area);
                }
            }            
        </code></pre>

        <h4>6. Classes & Objects</h4>
        <p>Object-oriented programming with classes.</p>
        <p>In Java, a class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, defining the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. A class might have fields to represent an object’s data (like a person’s name and age) and methods to define actions the object can perform. For example, a class Person could have fields for name and age, and a method introduce that prints a greeting. Classes also contain constructors, special methods used to initialize objects when they’re created. A constructor shares the same name as the class and has no return type, helping to set up the initial state of the object’s fields.

            Objects are instances of a class, created using the new keyword, and each object has its own set of field values that can be modified independently of other objects. For example, an instance of Person created with Person person1 = new Person(); can have its name and age fields set individually. Once created, we can access the object’s fields and methods using the dot . operator, such as person1.introduce().</p>
        <pre><code>
            public class Person {
                // Fields (attributes)
                String name;
                int age;
            
                // Constructor
                public Person(String name, int age) {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.age = age;
                }
            
                // Method (behavior)
                public void introduce() {
                    System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");

        <h4>8. Modules & Libraries</h4>
        <p>In Java, modules represent a group of related packages and resources bundled together, promoting modular programming, a feature introduced in Java 9. Modules improve code organization, encapsulation, and dependency management, making applications more scalable and maintainable. A module is defined in a `module-info.java` file, where you can specify the module's dependencies using the `requires` keyword and declare which packages are accessible to other modules using the `exports` keyword. For example, a module named `MyModule` might require the `java.sql` module and export a specific package like `com.mycompany.myapp`. 
            On the other hand, **libraries** in Java are pre-written collections of classes and methods designed to handle common tasks such as data manipulation, networking, and I/O operations. Libraries help accelerate development by providing reusable code. They can be categorized into **standard libraries**, which are part of the Java Standard Library (JDK) and include packages like `java.util` and `java.io`, and **external libraries**, which are created by third parties, such as Apache Commons, Google Guava, and Gson. To use these libraries, you can import the required packages directly for standard libraries, while external libraries can be included as dependencies through build tools like Maven or Gradle. For instance, in a Maven project, you can specify an external library like Gson in the `pom.xml` file. 
            Build tools like **Maven** and **Gradle** simplify dependency management, allowing developers to specify libraries in configuration files, thereby streamlining the build process. With these tools, Java developers can create organized, reusable, and scalable applications that leverage both modularization and a wide array of libraries to enhance functionality and efficiency.</p>
        <pre><code>
            package com.example.json;

            import com.google.gson.Gson;
            
            public class JsonConverter {
                private Gson gson = new Gson();
            
                // Converts an object to JSON
                public String convertToJson(Object obj) {
                    return gson.toJson(obj);
                }
            
                // Converts JSON back to an object
                public <T> T convertFromJson(String json, Class<T> clazz) {
                    return gson.fromJson(json, clazz);
                }
            }            
        </code></pre>

        <h4>9. Error Handling</h4>
        <p><strong>Exception Handling</strong>: Exception handling is a mechanism to manage runtime errors, allowing the program to continue executing rather than terminating abruptly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Checked Exceptions</strong></li>
            <p>These are checked at compile-time (e.g., IOException, SQLException). The compiler requires these to be handled or declared in the method signature.</p>
            <li><strong>Unchecked Exceptions</strong></li>
            <p>These are not checked at compile-time (e.g., NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException). They occur at runtime and are usually the result of programming errors.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>Handle by using a <strong>Try-Catch-Finally</strong> block</p>
        <pre><code>
            try {
                // Code that may throw an exception
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // Handle exception
            } finally {
                System.out.println("This block always executes.");
            }            
        </code></pre>
        <p>Handle by using Throwing Exceptions</p>
        <pre><code>
            public void checkAge(int age) {
                if (age < 18) {
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be at least 18.");
                }
            }
